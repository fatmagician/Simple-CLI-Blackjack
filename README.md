# Title: Simple CLI Blackjack

# Description

This is a simple Blackjack game written in Python that runs in the command line interface. It was created as a project while learning Python.

The game is currently only set up to be played between one player and a dealer. I plan on updating the game and adding more features over time as I learn more.

For the full rules of Blackjack, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack 

# Instructions
1. When the file is run, it will deal the player and dealer each 2 cards. One of the dealer's cards will be facedown.
2. When prompted to hit or stand, type "hit" or "h" to hit, or "stand" or "s" to stand.
3. Play will continue until the player chooses to stand, or the player "busts" by getting more than 21 points in their hand. If the player busts, then the dealer wins. If the player stands, then the dealer will draw until they have 17 points or more in their hand. If the dealer has over 17 points, they will stand.
4. Whoever has the most points in their hand at the end of the hand wins. If both players have the same number of points, it is a push (tie).
5. At the end of each hand, a counter will keep track of the player's and dealer's total number of wins.
6. At the end of hand, the player will be prompted if they would like to play again. Respond "yes" or "y" to play again, or "no" or "n" to stop playing.

# Features Not Yet Added
This game was created as a project while learning Python, and there are certain Blackjack features not yet implemented in it. I plan on updating the game over time as I learn more.

Some features not yet included:
1. Multiple players. Currently it is only set up for one player and a dealer.
2. Betting. Currently there is no betting component, just win or lose.
3. Splitting hands. In regular Blackjack, a player can "split" their hand if they're dealt two of the same cards, and play two separate hands at the same time. This feature has not yet been incorporated.
4. Changing the value of more than one Ace in the player's hand to 1. Only the value of the first Ace in a player's or dealer's hand can be changed from 11 to 1.
